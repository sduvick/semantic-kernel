## Comparison helpers
If you need to compare two values, you can use the `\{{equals}}` helper.
To use the {{#if allowLoops}}math and {{/if}}comparison helpers, you must pass in two positional values. For example, to check if the variable `var` is equal to number `1`, you would use the following helper like so: `\{{#if (equals var 1)}}\{{/if}}`.
