## Variable helpers
If you need to create or retrieve a variable, you can use the following helpers:
- `\{{set}}` – Creates a variable with the given name and value. It does not print anything to the template, so you must use `\{{json}}` to print the value.
- `\{{json}}` – Serializes the given value and prints result as JSON string.
- `\{{concat}}` – Concatenates the given values into one string.
