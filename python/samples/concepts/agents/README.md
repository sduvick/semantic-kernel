# Semantic Kernel Agents - Getting Started

This project contains a step by step guide to get started with _Semantic Kernel Agents_ in Python.

#### PyPI:

- For the use of agents, the minimum allowed Semantic Kernel pypi version is 1.3.0.

#### Source

- [Semantic Kernel Agent Framework](../../../semantic_kernel/agents/)

## Examples

The getting started with agents examples include:

| Example                                     | Description                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [step1_agent](../agents/step1_agent.py)     | How to create and use an agent.         |
| [step2_plugins](../agents/step2_plugins.py) | How to associate plugins with an agent. |

## Configuring the Kernel

Similar to the Semantic Kernel Python concept samples, it is necessary to configure the secrets
and keys used by the kernel. See the follow "Configuring the Kernel" [guide](../README.md#configuring-the-kernel) for
more information.

## Running Concept Samples

Concept samples can be run in an IDE or via the command line. After setting up the required api key
for your AI connector, the samples run without any extra command line arguments.
